# RSA
security project includes communication between two clients in one server with RSA encryption algorithm and breaking it with CCA (chosen cipher attack)using python socket

# To use you need to run first:
pip install sockets

pip install matplotlib

pip install math

# To stablish communication 
run server.py then client_A.py and client_B.py

# To test attacks 
run attacks.py

# Efficiency: encryption time VS key length
